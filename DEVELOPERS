Hi

Feel free to hack, tweak, change, modify anything you want. But please be
warned, if you make a change to the engine ie. aphex, triton, or the sources
in src/ and you email it to the devel list - it'll go under serious scrutiny
and has a potential to be rejected (this is not a personal thing but it may
just not fit with the vision or direction that the engine wants to go in)

Bug fixes are more than welcome :)

Patches will not be accepted unless they comply to the BSD licensing of
ferite. This means that you retain a copyright on your code - but you can't
make any provisions that restrict ferite from being distributed as it is.

Have fun and we look forward to hearing from you,

Chris Ross
Lead Developer
