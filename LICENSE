Please note, ferite will remain under the BSD license.

 o If a GPL program wishes to embed ferite, they may *but* ferite will 
   remain BSD. You do not have to provide you changes to ferite but we ask
   that you do
 o If people wish to code modules that link and are used within the ferite
   engine, they may be GPL *but* ferite will remain BSD.
 o The general trend is that people open their modules they write so everyone
   can benifit from the code.
