The point of good compilers is world domination. The point of not-so-good
compilers is to serve quality coffee at an affordable price.

To build ferite run:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ su -c 'make install'
  
The ferite and c api documentation will automatically be generated when you install ferite. You can find all the documentation for ferite in
$prefix/share/doc/ferite. There should be the pdf versions of the manual,
embed guide, and feritedoc tool, as well as html versions in the 
html-manual directory that can be found there. All example scripts will
be copied to $prefix/share/doc/ferite/examples.

The default prefix is usually /usr/local
