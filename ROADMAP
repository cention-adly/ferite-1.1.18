This is the generalised roadmap for ferite versions.

 - To Be Done
 ? In the process of being done
 * Done

0.99.1:
  * Static methods and variables on classes (boris)
  * "namespace extends <foo>" syntax (boris)
  * autoloading of functions (boris)
  
0.99.2:
  * eval operator on regular expressions (Boris)
  * Operators (boris)
    * bit shifts ( "<<", ">>" )
	* assignment ("<<=", ">>=", "&=", "|=" )
	* bit filed ops ( "&" (and), "|"(inc or), "~"(ex or), "^" ) - for better
	  native fudging - will also require adding 0x... to the compiler,
	* negative - +

0.99.3:
  * new build system that is autotools pure (boris)
  * Autoload method for classes (boris)
  * Variable argument lists (boris)
  * include() (boris)
  
0.99.4
  * array initialisers (boris)
  * switch statement (boris)
  * Initialisers for variables within namespace and global scope (boris)
     -> these will only be simple value assignment rather than 
	    the more complex expression based initlisers on functions
  * file, and line number for the current opcode. (boris)
  
0.99.5:
  * array code re-write (boris)
  * better regexp system (boris)
  * new module system (boris)
  * opcodes as numbers not pointers (Boris)
  * reflection (ntropy)
  * threading (boris)
  
0.99.6
  * foreach (boris)
  * method overloading (boris)
  * complete development document
  * optimsations (stephan)
    * hash caching and optimsation
    * disposable variable caching
    * various structure caching
  * per thread error handling (boris)

0.99.7
  * backtraces (boris)
  * private, protected, and public class attributes/methods (boris)
  * abstract and final classes (boris)
  * sanity work on the oo system (boris)
  * static constructor and desctructor on classes (boris)
  * closures (closure, using, deliver) (boris)
  * move regular expression code from core to module (boris)
  * backtraces (boris)
  * Update documents
	
1.0 pre-releases 
  - windows port [vc] (boris - or anyone else who wants it :)
  - Brush up documentation and clean up apis
  - Bug fixing and testing

1.0 release candidates
  - Critical bug fixes

At this point CVS will become 1.1.0.

Bug fixes will be applied to both stable and unstable. Only unstable
with gain new features.

MAJOR.odd.x == unstable branch, released side-by-side with stable
MAJOR.even.x == stable branch.

post 1.0
  - frame archive, server, module build and install mechanism
  - re-entrant compiler
  - boolean type ?
  - basic types as objects or transparent namespace access (boris)
  - saving of compiled scripts (boris)
  - gui layer
