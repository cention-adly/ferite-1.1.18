What is aphex?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
aphex is a library to absrtact certain things and move them out of the core
ferite engine, and expeand with more convinience apis, currently this is:

  loading of files - allowing for search paths so you can ask aphex to load
                     a relative file and it'll search paths for you
  
  directory reading - functions that allow you to read the contents of a
                      directory
					  
  configuration reading/writing
  
Eventually it'll allow sandboxing of the ferite engine

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Once aphex is stable - to port the core engine to a new os you just need to
port aphex and triton.
